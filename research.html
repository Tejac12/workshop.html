        <li>What is the use of meta tag with attr name and value viewport name="viewport"?
            <p>Without a viewport meta tag, mobile devices render pages at typical desktop screen widths and then scale
                the pages down, making them difficult to read.
                Setting the viewport meta tag lets you control the width and scaling of the viewport so that it's sized
                correctly on all devices.

            The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

            Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for
            web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.</p>
